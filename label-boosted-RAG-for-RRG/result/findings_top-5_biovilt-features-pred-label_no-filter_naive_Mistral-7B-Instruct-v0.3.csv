s5,"s3, s2, s4, s1","You are an expert radiological assistant.
Your task is to generate a radiology report after <<Report>> given context information.
The context information contains examples of reports written for similar cases.
Use the examples to generate a report for the current case.
Strictly follow the instructions below to generate the reports.

**Instructions**

1. The report must be based on the information in the context.
2. The report must mimic the style of the reports shown in the context.
3. Do not generate blank reports.

CONTEXT:
Example: 1
Consolidation noted in the right middle lobe. No other abnormalities detected.

Example: 2
Cardiomegaly with enlarged cardiac silhouette. No acute findings.

Example: 3
Bilateral pulmonary edema with typical vascular redistribution. No other significant findings.

Example: 4
Atelectasis noted in the right lower lobe. No other significant findings.


Now generate the report for the current case. Always generate reports based on the examples shown.
<<Report>>
","Enlarged cardiomediastinum with widened mediastinal contours. Support devices in place.
","
In this case, there is a finding of a mass in the left upper lobe. No other abnormalities were detected. The mass appears to be well-circumscribed and homogeneous in density. Further imaging or biopsy is recommended for characterization and potential treatment planning."
